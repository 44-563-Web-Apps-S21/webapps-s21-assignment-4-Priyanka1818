   <h4>SCENE II. The Mart.</h4> 
<p class = "satge-direction">Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse, and First Merchant</p>
<h4 class ="name Merchant">First Merchant</h4>
<p>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
    Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
    This very day a Syracusian merchant
    Is apprehended for arrival here;
    And not being able to buy out his life
    According to the statute of the town,
    Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
    There is your money that I had to keep.
    ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE">OF SYRACUSE </h4>
<p>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
    And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
    Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
    Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
    Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
    And then return and sleep within mine inn,
    For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
    Get thee away.</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE "> DROMIO OF </h4>
<p>Many a man would take you at your word,
    And go indeed, having so good a mean.
    Exit
    
    ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE">OF SYRACUSE </h4>
<p>A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
    When I am dull with care and melancholy,
    Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
    What, will you walk with me about the town,
    And then go to my inn and dine with me?</p>
<h4 class ="name Merchant">First Merchant</h4>
<p>I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
And afterward consort you till bed-time:
My present business calls me from you now.
ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE">OF SYRACUSE</h4>
<p>Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
And wander up and down to view the city.</p>
<h4 class="name Merchant"> First Merchant  </h4>
<p>Sir, I commend you to your own content.
Exit

ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE"> OF SYRACUSE</h4>
<p>He that commends me to mine own content
Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
I to the world am like a drop of water
That in the ocean seeks another drop,
Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
So I, to find a mother and a brother,
In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.</p>
<p class ="stage directory">Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

Here comes the almanac of my true date.
What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?</p>
<h4 class ="name EPHESUS">DROMIO OF </h4>
<p>Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
She is so hot because the meat is cold;
The meat is cold because you come not home;
You come not home because you have no stomach;
You have no stomach having broke your fast;
But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
Are penitent for your default to-day.
ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE">OF SYRACUSE </h4>
<p>Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
Where have you left the money that I gave you?</p>
<h4 class ="name EPHESUS">DROMIO OF </h4>
<p>O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
ANTIPHOLUS</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE"> OF SYRACUSE </h4>
<p>I am not in a sportive humour now:
Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
So great a charge from thine own custody?</p>
<h4 class ="name EPHESUS">DROMIO OF </h4>
<p>I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
I from my mistress come to you in post;
If I return, I shall be post indeed,
For she will score your fault upon my pate.
Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
And strike you home without a messenger.</p>
