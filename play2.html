<p>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
    Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
    This very day a Syracusian merchant
    Is apprehended for arrival here;
    And not being able to buy out his life
    According to the statute of the town,
    Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
    There is your money that I had to keep.

<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE">OF SYRACUSE </h4>
<p>Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
    And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
    Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
    Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
    Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
    And then return and sleep within mine inn,
    For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
    Get thee away.</p>
<h4 class ="name SYRACUSE "> DROMIO OF </h4>
<p>Many a man would take you at your word,
    And go indeed, having so good a mean.
    Exit
